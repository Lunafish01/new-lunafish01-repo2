      <p>
        This is my professional Junior Web Develeopment Portfolio! Im a new Web
        Developer on my way to completing the UTSA Web Developemnt Bootcamp. I
        will showcase some of my best work and contiue to add to this portfolio
        as I grow as a developer.
        <br></br>
        Im 36 years old and currently reside in San Antonio, TX. Over the
        course of my Web Development journey I have learned that I enjoy backend
        development and databases the most. I am currently looking for my first
        Junior Web Develeopment position and/or internship to kick start my career. Right
        now I work for Spotify doing markeing consulting for SMB. With 10+ years in sales
        and marketing, I believe I have an advantage in Web Development when it
        comes to communitcating to the client effectively. Please do not be
        afraid to reach me either by phone or email for any available positions.
